**Day 2 of My 60-Day DevOps Journey**
🖥️ **Linux Essentials — Terminal, File System, Users & Permissions**

Today I really got my hands dirty with the backbone of modern computing: **Linux**.
No desktop interface, just pure terminal — and honestly, it felt powerful. ⚡

📁 **Getting Comfortable with the Linux File System**

🔹 Navigated like a pro using `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`
🔹 Explored directories: `/`, `/etc`, `/usr`, `/home`, `/var`
🔹 Managed files like a boss with `touch`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm`
💡 *Note to self: double-check before using `rm -rf` 😬*

👤 **User & Group Management Basics**

🔹 Identified user info with `whoami`, `id`
🔹 Added users and groups with `useradd`, `groupadd`
🔹 Modified access using `usermod`
🔹 Finally understood why being root all the time is a bad idea 🚫

🔐 **Permissions: rwx and Beyond**

🔹 Learned the power of `chmod` and `chown`
🔹 Understood how file ownership and access actually work
🔹 Permissions now make sense — and I feel way more in control.

⚙️ **Bonus: Wrote My First Bash Script**

```bash
# hello.sh
echo "Hey, Linux world!"
```

👨‍💻 From clicks to commands — this shift in mindset is real.
Day 2 done and feeling even more hyped for what’s ahead! 🚀
